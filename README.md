# **Practice IV**

## **Description**

In this assignment, create a mobile application that uses Firebase authentication and database. Moreover, you will be able to incorporate advanced UI elements such as Fragments and Navigation Drawer. This time you will be able to choose whatever format you would like to use for the application, and you may be able to create any entities to store information on Firebase. On the other hand, below you may find the general requirements for the application.

### Requirements:

1.  Create a SplahScreen for the Application. The SplashScreen will redirect to a login page. Let's call it LoginActivity. In LoginActivity, you will implement user authentication using Firebase. If the user is not registered in Firebase, you might include an option to sign up, which may redirect to another activity, where the user the include the details, and confirm the new account.
    
2.  Once the user is logged in, the User Name will be able to see NavigationDrawer, which might include the user's name (therefore, you might need to use an intent to pass the user's information). The Navigation Drawer can have as many options (functionalities) as you wish. However, one of the options should allow showing a list of items (e.g., courses, movies, products, books) in a RecyclerView that is specified within a Fragment.
    
3.  The application should connect to a Firebase database. You should be able to query, insert, and delete items from the database. 
4.  Each option in the Navigation Drawer may instantiate a different UI in the Fragment. For example, you may create a UI for visualizing items, seeing the user's account information, logging out, or switching language. Each option should have its respective icon.
    

### Deliverables:

*   The source code for the Android app.
*   A brief write-up explaining the key design decisions and challenges faced during the development process.
*   A video demonstrating the app's functionality.
